Description: A virtual game based on the Monty Hall Problem will be played. The contestant is asked to pick one of three doors. Behind two of the doors are goats and behind the third is a car, the contestants potential prize. Upon choosing a door, one of the remaining two doors with a goat behind it will be opened by the host. The contestant has the option to keep their initial door pick or switch to the other closed door. After selecting the final door, the host will reveal if the contestant won the car or lost by choosing a door with a goat behind it.
